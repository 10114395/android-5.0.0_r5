<p>This sample demonstrates how to use {@link android.support.v4.widget.SwipeRefreshLayout} to add
the <em>swipe-to-refresh</em> gesture to a {@link android.view.View}, which enables you to trigger
a refresh by swiping down on the {@link android.view.View}. In this sample, the view that can
be freshed is a {@link android.widget.ListView}.</p>
