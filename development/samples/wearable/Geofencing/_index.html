<p><b>About:</b> When a user enters the vicinity of the Android building (B44) or the Yerba Buena
Gardens near the Moscone center in San Francisco, a notification silently appears on his/her
wearable with an option to check in. This notification automatically disappears when he/she leaves
the area, and reappears the next time he/she is at one of these locations.</p>
<p><b>How to run:</b> Install the Application APK on the companion, and the Wearable APK on the
wearable. Then, start "Android Wear Geofencing Example Application" on the companion. You will
automatically be notified on the wearable if you enter one of the two specified areas, assuming
you have your phone on you.</p>
<p><b>Wearable APIs used:</b> DataApi, WearableListenerService</p>
<p><b>Other APIs used:</b> Play Services API used for Geofencing (Geofence and LocationClient)</p>
