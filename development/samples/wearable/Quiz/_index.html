<p><b>About:</b> This sample uses Google Play Services Wearable Data APIs to communicate between
applications on a phone and a paired wearable device. Users can create quiz questions on the phone,
each of which has an associated DataItem. These DataItems are then received on the wearable, which
displays them as notifications. Each notification contains the question as the first page, followed
by answers as actions. When an answer is selected, the corresponding question's DataItem is updated,
which allows the phone application to update the status of the question (i.e. did the user answer it
correctly or not) and prompt the next question.
</p>
<p>At the end of the quiz, the sample uses the Google Play Services Wearable Message APIs to create
an end-of-quiz report notification on the wearable, with an option to reset the quiz (by sending a
message back to the phone).</p>
<p><b>How to run:</b> Install the Application APK on the companion, and the Wearable APK on the
wearable. Start the sample by running the Quiz application on the companion.</p>
<p><b>Wearable APIs used:</b> DataApi, MessageApi, NodeApi, WearableListenerService</p>
