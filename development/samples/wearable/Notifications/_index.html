<p><b>About:</b> This sample application provides a showcase of available notification styles and
demonstrates various features of the Android Wear notifications API. Running the sample on your
companion allows you to select between various notification styles and to see how these
notifications are displayed, both in a phone's notification shade and on the wearable. The companion
application allows you to create the following types of notifications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Basic notification</li>
    <li>"Inbox style" notification: multiple lines of text</li>
    <li>"Big picture style" notification: a full-screen background image for the card on the
        wearable</li>
    <li>"Big text style" notification: a tall card that is collapsed and can be expanded with a
        tap</li>
    <li>"Big action style" notification: tapping anywhere on the card triggers the notification
        content intent</li>
    <li>Notification with multiple pages: swipe horizontally to view the second page</li>
    <li>Bundled Notifications: a stack of cards that can be individually expanded</li>
</ul>
<p>This sample also allows you to toggle other attributes for each of these notification types,
including whether a content intent or action are included, and whether the notification is marked as
"local only," indicating that it should not be bridged between devices.</p>
<p>You can also run a separate APK on your wearable for even more customizable notifications. The
wearable notification styles include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A notification drawn with a custom display Activity, using setDisplayIntent</li>
    <li>A notification styled using SpannableStrings</li>
    <li>A notification page with bottom-aligned text</li>
    <li>A notification with a "content icon"</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How to run:</b> Install the Application APK on the companion, and/or the Wearable APK on the
wearable. Start the sample by running the Wearable Notifications application on the companion, or
by starting the Wearable Notifications application on the wearable. To do the latter, go to the
voice menu - either by saying Ok Google or tapping the home screen - and select the "Start..."
option. Then, select "Wearable Notifications" from the submenu.</p>
<p><b>Wearable APIs used:</b> Notification.WearableExtender, Notification.BigTextStyle,
Notification.BigPictureStyle (note that NotificationCompat, rather than Notification, is used on the
companion side in order to be compatible with older versions of Android).</p>
