<p><b>About: </b>
This sample is a phone application that provides a chat experience in which users can respond to
messages with a quick voice response. New messages create a notification with a "Reply" action.
The notification is bridged from phone to wearable, and selecting the "Reply" action on the
wearable opens the voice transcription UI allowing the user to speak a response.</p>

<p>To keep the example simple and self-contained, instead of a real chat application (which would
require a server or a peer-to-peer connection), the conversation is conducted with an chat bot on
the phone. Each time the bot responds, the phone app updates the notification and allows the user
to write back. This sample is primarily intended to demonstrate the voice-reply capabilities
provided by the Android Wear notification API.</p>

<p>When using the emulator you can type a response instead of speaking it aloud. To allow typed
responses, ensure that your emulator image has the "hardware keyboard present" option enabled.
After typing your message into the emulator window, hit the enter key and wait a few seconds for
your message to be sent.</p>


<p><b>How to run:</b> Install the Application APK on the companion and run it. A notification will
automatically be bridged onto the wearable, with a "Reply" action.</p>
