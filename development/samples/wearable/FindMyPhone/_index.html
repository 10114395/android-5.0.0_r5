<p><b>About:</b> This sample application notifies you when you may have left your phone behind
(specifically, when your companion and wearable disconnect). If you have misplaced your phone, but
it is still connected to your wearable, you can also start an activity on the wearable to sound an
alarm on your phone.</p>
<p><b>How to run:</b> Install the Application APK on the companion, and the Wearable APK on the
wearable. A notification will automatically appear on the wearable when the wearable and companion
disconnect. To start the FindMyPhone activity on the wearable, go to the voice menu (either by
saying "OK Google" or tapping the home screen) and select the "Start..." option. Then, select
"Find My Phone" from the submenu.</p>
<p><b>Wearable APIs used:</b> DataApi, WearableListenerService</p>
