            This sample demonstrates how to create a managed profile. You can also learn how to
            enable or disable other apps and how to set restrictions to them. Intents can be
            configured to be forwarded between primary account and managed profile. Finally, you can
            wipe all the data associated with the profile.
            Note that there can only be one managed profile on a device.
