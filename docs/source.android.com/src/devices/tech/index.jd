<p>Welcome to the Android technical documentation section of the site. Here you
can find technical information useful to people and organizations who are
looking to modify, contribute to, or port the Android software. This is "under
the hood" information intended for engineers.</p>

<h2 id="accessory-protocol-information">Accessory Protocol Information</h2>
<p>Android devices can connect to hardware accessories, such as audio docks,
keyboards and custom hardware, through USB or Bluetooth. This document
describes the Android Open Accessory protocol for accessory hardware builders.</p>

<h2 id="dalvik-technical-information">Dalvik Technical Information</h2>
<p>The Dalvik Virtual Machine is the heart of Android. It's a fast, just-in-time
compiled, optimized bytecode virtual machine. Android applications are
compiled to Dalvik bytecode and run on the Dalvik VM. This section includes
detailed information such as the Dalvik bytecode format specification,
design information on the VM itself, and so on.</p>
