Description:

This library lets you enter, validate, and display an address with correct
semantics for many countries around the world. The library uses the serialized
validation rules from a Google-managed server (without SLA) at
https://i18napis.appspot.com/ssl-aggregate-address. The library is used in
requestAutocomplete dialog and autofill.

Local Modifications:
- The package is libaddressinput at revision 176 plus the Chrome-specific
  validation logic, which will be upstreamed back to libaddressinput
  (http://crbug.com/327046). The Chrome-specific version is in chromium/cpp/
  subdirectory. The original source code is in src/cpp/ subdirectory. Both
  versions use the original test data file src/testdata/countryinfo.txt.
- Serbia and Montenegro (YU) was removed as a supported region.
