<h1>Bluetooth</h1>

<p>
  This document describes how to use the <a href="bluetooth.html">Bluetooth</a>,
  <a href="bluetoothSocket.html">Bluetooth Socket</a> and
  <a href="bluetoothLowEnergy.html">Bluetooth Low Energy</a> APIs to
  communicate with Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy devices.
</p>

<p>
  For background information about Bluetooth, see the official
  <a href="http://www.bluetooth.org">Bluetooth specifications</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest requirements</h2>

<p>
  For Chrome Apps that use Bluetooth, add the
  <a href="manifest/bluetooth">bluetooth</a> entry to the manifest
  and specify, if appropriate, the UUIDs of profiles, protocols or services
  you wish to implement along with whether you wish to implement these with the
  socket and/or Low Energy APIs.
</p>

<p>
  For example for a socket implementation:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"bluetooth": {
  "uuids": [ "1105", "1106" ],
  "socket": true
}
</pre>

<p>
  And for a Low Energy implementation:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"bluetooth": {
  "uuids": [ "180D", "1809", "180F" ],
  "low_energy": true
}
</pre>

<p>
  To only access adapter state, discover nearby devices, and obtain basic
  information about devices, only the entry itself is required:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"bluetooth": { }
</pre>

<h2 id="adapter_info">Adapter information</h2>

<h3 id="adapter_state">Obtaining adapter state</h3>

<p>
  To obtain the state of the Bluetooth adapter, use the
  $(ref:bluetooth.getAdapterState) method:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getAdapterState(function(adapter) {
  console.log("Adapter " + adapter.address + ": " + adapter.name);
});
</pre>

<h3 id="adapter_notifications">Adapter notifications</h3>

<p>
  The $(ref:bluetooth.onAdapterStateChanged) event is sent
  whenever the adapter state changes. This can be used, for example, to
  determine when the adapter radio is powered on or off.
</p>

<pre>
var powered = false;
chrome.bluetooth.getAdapterState(function(adapter) {
  powered = adapter.powered;
});

chrome.bluetooth.onAdapterStateChanged.addListener(
  function(adapter) {
    if (adapter.powered != powered) {
      powered = adapter.powered;
      if (powered) {
        console.log("Adapter radio is on");
      } else {
        console.log("Adapter radio is off");
      }
    }
  });
</pre>

<h2 id="device_info">Device information</h2>

<h3 id="listing_devices">Listing known devices</h3>

<p>
  To get a list of the devices known to the Bluetooth adapter, use the
  $(ref:bluetooth.getDevices) method:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    console.log(devices[i].address);
  }
});
</pre>

<p>
  All devices are returned, including paired devices and devices recently
  discovered. It will not begin discovery of new devices (see
  <a href="#discovery">Discovering nearby devices</a>).
</p>

<h3 id="device_notifications">Receiving device notifications</h3>

<p>
  Instead of repeatedly calling $(ref:bluetooth.getDevices), you
  can use the $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceAdded), $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceChanged)
  and $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved) events to receive notifications.
</p>

<p>
  The $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceAdded) event is sent whenever a
  device is discovered by the adapter or makes a connection to the adapter:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceAdded.addListener(function(device) {
  console.log(device.address);
});
</pre>

<p>
  Adding a listener for this event does not begin discovery of devices
  (see <a href="#discovery">Discovering nearby devices</a>).
</p>

<p>
  Changes to devices, including previously discovered devices becoming paired,
  are notified by the $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceChanged) event:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceChanged.addListener(function(device) {
  console.log(device.address);
});
</pre>

<p>
  Finally the $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved) event is sent
  whenever a paired device is removed from the system, or a discovered device
  has not been seen recently:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved.addListener(function(device) {
  console.log(device.address);
});
</pre>

<h3 id="discovery">Discovering nearby devices</h3>

<p>
  To begin discovery of nearby devices, use the
  $(ref:bluetooth.startDiscovery) method. Discovery can be resource intensive
  so you should call $(ref:bluetooth.stopDiscovery) when done.
</p>

<p>
  You should call $(ref:bluetooth.startDiscovery) whenever your
  app needs to discover nearby devices. Do not make the call conditional on
  the <code>discovering</code> property of $(ref:bluetooth.AdapterState). The
  call will succeed even if another app is discovering nearby devices, and will
  ensure the adapter continues to perform discovery after that other app has
  stopped.
</p>

<p>
  Information about each newly discovered device is received using the
  $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceAdded) event. For devices that have
  already been discovered recently, or have been previously paired with or
  connected to, the event will not be sent. Instead you should call
  $(ref:bluetooth.getDevices) to obtain the current information,
  and use the $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceChanged) event to be notified of changes
  to that information as a result of discovery.
</p>

<p>
  Example:
</p>

<pre>
var device_names = {};
var updateDeviceName = function(device) {
  device_names[device.address] = device.name;
};
var removeDeviceName = function(device) {
  delete device_names[device.address];
}

// Add listeners to receive newly found devices and updates
// to the previously known devices.
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceAdded.addListener(updateDeviceName);
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceChanged.addListener(updateDeviceName);
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved.addListener(removeDeviceName);

// With the listeners in place, get the list of devices found in
// previous discovery sessions, or any currently active ones,
// along with paired devices.
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    updateDeviceName(devices[i]);
  }
});

// Now begin the discovery process.
chrome.bluetooth.startDiscovery(function() {
  // Stop discovery after 30 seconds.
  setTimeout(function() {
    chrome.bluetooth.stopDiscovery(function() {});
  }, 30000);
});
</pre>

<p>
  If the user turns off the Bluetooth radio, all discovery sessions will be
  ended and not resumed automatically when the radio is switched on. If this
  matters to your app, you should watch the
  $(ref:bluetooth.onAdapterStateChanged) event. If the
  <code>discovering</code> property changes to <code>false</code>, then your app
  will need to call $(ref:bluetooth.startDiscovery) again to
  resume. Be cautious of the resource intensive nature of discovery.
</p>

<h3 id="identifying_devices">Identifying devices</h3>

<p>
  A number of different options are provided for identifying devices returned
  by $(ref:bluetooth.getDevices) and the related events.
</p>

<p>
  If the device supports the Bluetooth
  <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/DI.aspx">Device ID specification</a>,
  several properties are added to the Device object containing the fields
  defined by that specification. Example:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    if (devices[0].vendorIdSource != undefined) {
      console.log(devices[0].address + ' = ' +
                  devices[0].vendorIdSource + ':' +
                  devices[0].vendorId.toString(16) + ':' +
                  devices[0].productId.toString(16) + ':' +
                  devices[0].deviceId.toString(16));
    }
  }
});
</pre>

<p>
  The Device ID specification is usually sufficient to identify a particular
  model, and even revision, of a device from a vendor. Where it is not present,
  you must instead rely on information about the class or type of the device,
  optionally combined with the manufacturer prefix in the <code>address</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Most Bluetooth devices provide Class of Device information as a bit-field
  interpreted according to the
  <a href="https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/assigned-numbers/baseband">Baseband Assigned Numbers</a>
  document. This bit-field is available in the <code>deviceClass</code>
  property.
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    if (devices[0].vendorIdSource != undefined) {
      console.log(devices[0].address + ' = ' +
                  devices[0].deviceClass.toString(16));
    }
  }
});
</pre>

<p>
  Parsing the field can be complex so for the most common device types Chrome
  handles this for you and sets the <code>type</code> field. Where this is
  not available, or insufficient for your needs, you'll need to parse the
  <code>deviceClass</code> yourself.
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    if (devices[0].vendorIdSource != undefined) {
      console.log(devices[0].address + ' = ' + devices[0].type);
    }
  }
});
</pre>

<h2 id="using_rfcomm">Using RFCOMM and L2CAP</h2>

<p>
  Chrome Apps may make connections to any device that supports RFCOMM or
  L2CAP services. This includes the majority of classic Bluetooth devices on
  the market.
</p>

<h3 id="connecting">Connecting to a socket</h3>

<p>
  In order to make a connection to a device you need three things. A socket
  to make the connection with, created using $(ref:bluetoothSocket.create);
  the address of the device you wish to connect to, and the UUID of the
  service itself.
</p>

<p>
  Before making the connection you should verify that the adapter is aware of
  the device by using $(ref:bluetooth.getDevice) or the device
  discovery APIs.
</p>

<p>
  The information necessary to establish the underlying connection, including
  whether the RFCOMM or L2CAP protocol should be used and which channel or PSM,
  is obtained using SDP discovery on the device.
</p>

<p>
  Example:
</p>

<pre>
var uuid = '1105';
var onConnectedCallback = function() {
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
    console.log("Connection failed: " + chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
  } else {
    // Profile implementation here.
  }
};

chrome.bluetoothSocket.create(function(createInfo) {
  chrome.bluetoothSocket.connect(createInfo.socketId,
    device.address, uuid, onConnectedCallback);
});
</pre>

<p>
  Keep a handle to the socketId so that you can later send data
  ($(ref:bluetoothSocket.send)) to this socket.
</p>

<h3 id="receiving">Receiving from and sending to a socket</h3>

<p>
  Receiving data from and sending to a socket uses <code>ArrayBuffer</code>
  objects. To learn about ArrayBuffers, check out the overview,
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript_typed_arrays">JavaScript typed arrays</a>,
  and the tutorial,
  <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/06/How-to-convert-ArrayBuffer-to-and-from-String">How to convert ArrayBuffer to and from String</a>.
</p>

<p>
  To send data you have in <code>arrayBuffer</code> use
  $(ref:bluetoothSocket.send):
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothSocket.send(socketId, arrayBuffer, function(bytes_sent) {
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
    console.log("Send failed: " + chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
  } else {
    console.log("Sent " + bytes_sent + " bytes")
  }
})
</pre>

<p>
  In contrast to the method to send data, data is received in an event
  ($(ref:bluetoothSocket.onReceive). Sockets are created unpaused (see
  $(ref:bluetoothSocket.setPaused)) so the listener for this event is
  typically added between $(ref:bluetoothSocket.create) and
  $(ref:bluetoothSocket.connect).
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothSocket.onRecieve.addListener(function(receiveInfo) {
  if (receiveInfo.socketId != socketId)
    return;
  // receiveInfo.data is an ArrayBuffer.
});
</pre>

<h3 id="errors">Receiving socket errors and disconnection</h3>

<p>
  To be notified of socket errors, including disconnection, add a listener to
  the $(ref:bluetoothSocket.onReceiveError) event.
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothSocket.onReceiveError.addListener(function(errorInfo) {
  // Cause is in errorInfo.error.
  console.log(errorInfo.errorMessage);
});
</pre>

<h3 id="disconnection">Disconnecting from a socket</h3>

<p>
  To hang up the connection and disconnect the socket use
  $(ref:bluetoothSocket.disconnect).
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothSocket.disconnect(socketId);
</pre>

<h2 id="using_rfcomm">Publishing services</h2>

<p>
  In addition to making outbound connections to devices, Chrome Apps may
  publish services that may be used by any device that supports RFCOMM or
  L2CAP.
</p>

<h3 id="listening">Listening on a socket</h3>

<p>
  Two types of published service are supported. RFCOMM is the most commonly
  used and covers the majority of devices and profiles:
</p>

<pre>
var uuid = '1105';
chrome.bluetoothSocket.create(function(createInfo) {
  chrome.bluetoothSocket.listenUsingRfcomm(createInfo.socketId,
    uuid, onListenCallback);
});
</pre>

<p>
  L2CAP is the other and covers other device types and vendor-specific uses
  such as firmware uploading.
</p>

<pre>
var uuid = '0b87367c-f188-47cd-bc20-a5f4f70973c6';
chrome.bluetoothSocket.create(function(createInfo) {
  chrome.bluetoothSocket.listenUsingL2cap(createInfo.socketId,
    uuid, onListenCallback);
});
</pre>

<p>
  In both cases an optional $(ref:bluetoothSocket.ListenOptions) may be
  passed to allocate a specific channel or PSM. The callback indicates error
  through <code>chrome.runtime.lastError</code> and success otherwise.
  Keep a handle to the socketId so that you can later accept connections
  ($(ref:bluetoothSocket.onAccept)) from this socket.
</p>

<h3 id="accepting">Accepting client connections</h3>

<p>
  Client connections are accepted and passed to your application through the
  $(ref:bluetoothSocket.onAccept) event.
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothSocket.onAccept.addListener(function(acceptInfo) {
  if (info.socketId != serverSocketId)
    return;

  // Say hello...
  chrome.bluetoothSocket.send(acceptInfo.clientSocketId,
    data, onSendCallback);

  // Accepted sockets are initially paused,
  // set the onReceive listener first.
  chrome.bluetoothSocket.onReceive.addListener(onReceive);
  chrome.bluetoothSocket.setPaused(false);
});
</pre>

<h3 id="stop-accepting">Stop accepting client connections</h3>

<p>
  To stop accepting client connections and unpublish the service use
  $(ref:bluetoothSocket.disconnect).
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothSocket.disconnect(serverSocketId);
</pre>
