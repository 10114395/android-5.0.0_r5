DMT Standalone manipulation tools:
----------------------------------

There are two tools provided here to manipulate DMT data/meta-data:

convertMDF - this tool converts from the older text-based meta data 
             file (root.mdf) to the new binary format (root.bmdf).

             It takes a single argument, for example:

	     convertMDF test.mdf

	     After completion, a file called 'test.bmdf' will be
	     created in this directory.

generateDMT - This tool calls the necessary 'Gen tool' and python
	      script to build the data and meta-data for a DMT 
	      represented by a .zip file.  For more information on
	      on how to manipulate the Dmt.zip file, see the document
	      entitled 'DMTreeGeneration.doc' in the docs directory.

	      NOTE: This script requires that you set the environment
		    variable JAVA_HOME to the location where your Java
		    runtime is installed.

	      It takes one required and one optional argument, for example:

	      generateDMT ../path/to/Dmt.zip (this creates output dir 'treedata')

	      OR
	
	      generateDMT ../path/to/Dmt.zip /tmp (creates 'treedata' dir in /tmp)
             
	      Inside the 'treedata' directory are all of the wbxml files that
	      represent the DMT data (the source xml files are also included
  	      for debugging), as well as the necessary support files (acl.txt,
	      fstab, root.bmdf).  The text-based root.mdf is included for
	      debugging purposes.

              NOTE: The fstab file included in this directory is a SAMPLE only.
		    Please edit this file (it must be named 'fstab') to suit 
		    your own tree structure.

	      There is a subdirectory called 'docs' inside of 'treedata' which 
	      contains the javadoc-style html documentation for the tree 
	      schema.

The other subdirectories in this directory (bin and lib) contain necessary support
files/programs for the two tools above.
