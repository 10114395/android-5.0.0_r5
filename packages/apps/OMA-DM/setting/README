This directory contains files needed to generate DM Tree files. To add or 
modify tree:
1. Unzip Dmt.zip
2. Make necessary changes to metadata files under Dmt/ directory
3. Zip them to a new Dmt.zip
4. Run "make" to generate tree files, which also copy them to "assets" directory of DMService

File list
---------
Makefile - invokes generateDMT tool to generate tree files and copy them to DMService "assets" directory.
fstab - DM tree file list; used by generateDMT tool
event.dat - should be empty but file is needed by native DM engine
dmt_data - duplicate directory containing same tree files as "assets".
